# ai-dog-breed-classifier

The goal of this project is to build a classifier that can predict the breed of a
dog given a picture as an input. The Stanford Dog Dataset, which consists of
approximately 20K images of 120 different labeled breeds of dogs, will be
used for training. The final result of the project will be a trained model that
can be used as a baseline to create applications for dog lovers.
